# IsabelleDSL
IsabelleDSL (iDSL) is a framework for generating Domain-Specific Languages from specifications written in [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).

This project is part of my third-year Dissertation Project at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs), supervised by [Dr Andrei Popescu](https://www.andreipopescu.uk/)

## Building Manually

Once an `export_code` command has been added to a `.thy` file, it can be built manually with:

`isabelle build -e -D .`

The first time you run this, `HOL-Theory` will need to build. This can take some time depending on the speed of your computer, but should only need to be done once.

## generatedHaskellFiles

This directory has files generated by the Isabelle `build` command. The framework exports the `pp` function, which pretty prints an aspect of the system, and any of its dependencies.

To run the Haskell file manually:

```bash
$ ghci
Prelude> :load Calculator.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Calculator       ( Calculator.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.
*Calculator> pp GetResult
".getResult()"
*Calculator> pp (Clear GetResult)
".clear().getResult()"
*Calculator> pp (Add (Int_of_integer 5) (Sub (Int_of_integer 4) (Div (Int_of_integer 4) (GetResult))))
".add(5).sub(4).div(4).getResult()"
```
